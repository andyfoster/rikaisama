About
=====

This is my fork of the rikaikun chrome extension which has a long history of open-source changes and forking.

I'd like to add in Heisig keywords to this extension so that's why I've forked it.
After a brief initial look at the code I think I'm going to try and improve the readability and maintainability.



Installation
============

This is my first chrome extension, I've only just started playing around with it and there's no changes yet
from the Rikaikun extension.

If you want to try it out though do this:

```sh

git clone https://markburns@github.com/markburns/rikaisama.git
```


Amending
=========

* Open chrome
* Go to the extension menu
* Choose Load unpacked extension
* Add the Rikaisama directory

If you do any edits to the source code:

* Reload the extension.
* Reload the page.
* Restart Rikaisama.
